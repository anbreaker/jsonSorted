# JSON Sorting Project

This is a project that allows entering a JSON in a form and then sorting it alphabetically. The sorted result is displayed on the screen.

## How it works

The project is written in Vanilla JavaScript and uses the JSON.parse() library to convert the entered JSON into a JavaScript object. Then, it uses a recursive function to traverse each property of the object and sort them alphabetically.

The project also has some additional features, such as a warning that is displayed if the entered JSON is invalid and a "Sort" button that is disabled until a valid JSON is entered.

## How to use

To use the project, simply enter a valid JSON in the form on the web page. Then, click the "Sort" button to sort the JSON. The sorted result will be displayed on the screen.

If the entered JSON is invalid, a warning will be displayed on the screen and the "Sort" button will remain disabled until a valid JSON is entered.
